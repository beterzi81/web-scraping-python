<br/><br/><font color="white">East India Company a.k.a the British arrived in subcontinent for trade and business on 24th August,1608. After the battle of Plassey in 1757,East India Company transformed into a fully fledged empire taking control over the subcontinent.Seeing the disunity among people in India and carelessness of Mughals,Britishers continued to strengthen their rule in Subcontinent.Finally in the year 1857, a rebellion took place against the Britishers by the Mughals and locals but it became unsuccessfull.Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal Emperor was dethroned and the British Crown was established in the subcontinent.After these series of events,things started to become hard for Muslims in the SubContinent which later lead to a struggle for a seperate nation for the Muslims of Subcontinent.</font></td>

From 23rd March 1940 to 1947:<br/><br/><font color="#FFFF00">After 23rd March 1947,the Muslim leaders became firm on the stance that a seperate homeland/country for Muslims in subcontinent is the only solution to finish the religious conflicts between Muslims and Hindus.On the other hand while the British were busy in World-War2,the muslims leaders continued to gather all the Muslims in the United Subcontinent for the cause of a seperate homeland.After the British got free from wars,they started sending different proposals for Muslims of subcontinent.The proposals sent granted some rights to Muslims but none of them included the notion for seperate homeland for the Muslims,due to which it they got rejected by Muslims Leaders.Allama Muhammad Iqbal,the national poet of Pakistan,was the orijinal proposer for the idea of a seperate homeland for Muslims of the subcontinent.He used his poetry to encourage the Muslims.After the constant rejections of proposals sent by the British,the British understood that the making of a seperate homeland for Muslims is bound to happen. Thus on 3rd June 1947,plan to divide the subcontinent into two countries was proposed under specific conditions,which was accepted by both Muslims and Hindus.The Muslim majority areas became Pakistan while Hindu majority areas became India.
