The famous opera house,  Gran Teatre del Liceu is also present in Barcelona. Other important buildings include the museums of Picasso and Miro, Maritime Museum, Museum of Catalonian Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Also, present in the city is the famously beautiful street, La Rambla and the heart of Barcelona, the Catalonia Plaza.
If you visit Barcelona and wish to see it all in a single view, there is nothing Tibidabo. Tibidabo is a mountain, 512 m in height, which overlooks Barcelona. The city also has a number of small hills that have neighborhoods developed around them. Some of these hills include Carmel, Putxet, Rovira and Montjiuic that also has a castle at its top.
In addition to the numerous hills, there are a number of parks too in Barcelona. These natural parks vary in the type of flora and fauna on display. Often students from nearby countries come to these wetlands to conduct field studies. A few examples of Barcelona's parks are Garraf and Montserrat Natural Parks that are abundant in limestone, Ebro Delta wetlands, Garrotxa Volcanic Park, Montseny with a landscape full of alpines and Vall de Nuria with its spectacular glacial topography.
Different communities in Barcelona exist. Some of them are Sant Cugat del Valles, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvem, Sant Feliu de Llobregat, L'Hospitalet e Llobregat, El Prat de Llobregat and Santa Coloma de Gramenet.
All in all, Barcelona's geography makes it a very unique place and is sure to capture the attention and hearts of those who visit it</font></p>
