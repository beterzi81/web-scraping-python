<p><font size="5" color="#990066">Coober Pedy, town and mining field in central South Australia, 590 miles  northwest of Adelaide.Most of the total world production of opals comes from the mining site, located in the Stuart Range on the edge of the Great Victoria Desert.The towns unusual and bleak landscape, made even stranger by the mining efforts, has made it an attractive location for Hollywood. 
Coober Pedy has appeared in a number of movies, including Pitch Black, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome and Red Plane.The area does not support much life and the first TREE in the town was welded together from scrap iron. The metal tree can still be seen on a hill overlooking the town. The daytime temperatures of Cooper Pedy in the summer get so high than most sporting activities take place at night. 
One must be careful in Coober Pedy, however. The area around the town is riddled with pits and caverns dug in search of opals. This is especially true at night when one is out playing a round of glowing golf.
Coober Pedy is accessible via a small airstrip, via coach tour or private car, and via the Ghan railway line running between Darwin and Adelaide. </font></p>
