<p></p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all let's learn more about David Fincher. David Leo Fincher is an 
American movie director. Fincher received an Academy Award nomination 
and produced several cult films, including The Curious Case of Benjamin 
Button, Fight Club, The social Network. He also had great success with 
the episodes he directed in the series such as House of Cards and Mindhunter.<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason why he is one of my favourite directors is the way he projects 
tension to the audience. As someone who enjoys thrillers, I think he handles 
tension very successfully in his films. While most of his films are 
nerve-shredding, I'd say a few of his films are a bit boring.</p>
