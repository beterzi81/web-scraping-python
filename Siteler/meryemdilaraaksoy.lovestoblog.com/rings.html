		<p><font color="#BA8072" face="Candara Light" size="4"> - Firstly, we take a piece of clay and roll it and knead it until our hands get used to it.
		<br> - Then, we wet it with some water, roll it into a ball and smooth it with our hands.
		<br> - Next, we take our rolling pin and open our clay in a round shape.
		<br> - After that, we cut the dough into thin long pieces and glue the parts we cut into rings.
		<br> - Then, we make tiny decorations in the shapes we want and stick them on the top of the ring.
		<br> - We leave our rings to dry on wax paper. They should dry within two days.
		<br> - Then, we paint our rings with acrylic paint in the color and pattern we want.
		<br> - Finally, we varnish our rings so that the paint does not come off and wear out.
		<br> - I am sure that they're amazing. Enjoy it!
