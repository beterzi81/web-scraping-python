		<p><font color="#BA8072" face="Candara Light" size="4"> - Firstly, we take a piece of clay and roll it and knead it until our hands get used to it. 
		<br> - Then, we wet it with some water, roll it into a ball and smooth it with our hands.
		<br> - Then, we take our rolling pin and open our clay in a round shape. 
		<br> - After that, we cut our dough with a round shape in the size we want. 
		<br> - Next, we cut a rectangular piece long enough to surround it and place it by wrapping it around the round piece. 
		<br> - We fix the sticking points of the parts with our tools that we wet with water to stick the two parts together. 
		<br> - After that, we leave our candle holder to dry on wax paper. It should dry within two days. 
		<br> - Then, we paint our candle holder with acrylic paint in the color and pattern we want.
		<br> - Finally, we varnish our candle holder so that the paint does not come off and wear out.
		<br> - I am sure that it's amazing. Enjoy it!
