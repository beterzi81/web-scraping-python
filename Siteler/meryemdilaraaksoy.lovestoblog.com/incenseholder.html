		<p><font color="#BA8072" face="Candara Light" size="4"> - Firstly, we take a piece of clay and roll it and knead it until our hands get used to it.
		<br> - Then, we wet it with some water, roll it into a ball and smooth it with our hands.
		<br> - Next, we take our rolling pin and open our clay in a round shape. 
		<br> - After that, we cut our dough with a round shape in the size we want. 
		<br> - Then, we cut a short sized rectangular piece long enough to surround it and place it by wrapping it around the round piece.
		<br> - Next, we shape our dough into a tiny frog shape. We make legs and arms and glue them to the frog.
		<br> - After that, we glue our frog to the piece we made earlier.
		<br> - Then, we drill a tiny hole in the edge so that it can hold the incense stick.
		<br> - We leave our incense holder to dry on wax paper. It should dry within two days.
		<br> - Then, we paint our jewellery holder with acrylic paint in the color and pattern we want.
		<br> - Finally, we varnish our jewellery holder so that the paint does not come off and wear out.
		<br> - I am sure that it's amazing. Enjoy it!
