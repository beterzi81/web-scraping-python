		<p><font color="#BA8072" face="Candara Light" size="4"> - Firstly, we take a piece of clay and roll it and knead it until our hands get used to it.
		<br> - Then, we wet it with some water, roll it into a ball and smooth it with our hands.
		<br> - Then, we take our rolling pin and open our clay in a round shape. 
		<br> - After that, we cut our dough with a round shape in the size we want. 
		<br> - Next, we cut a short sized rectangular piece long enough to surround it and place it by wrapping it around the round piece.
		<br> - After that, we take a thick dough in our hands and shape it until it turns into a mushroom body.
		<br> - Then, we place the dough, which we have made into a mushroom body, on the base we have made.
		<br> - Now, we need to make the head of the mushroom. For this, we roll out our dough again thinly and cut a round piece.
		<br> - Next, we find the midpoint of this piece and start from there, we cut out a cone-shaped piece and throw it away.
		<br> - We did this because the head of our mushroom needs to be like a cone. 
		<br> - In order to give this slope to the piece, we glue the cut parts together.
		<br> - We place the piece that we have made into a cone on the cork body and leave the jewelry holder to dry.
		<br> - Then, we paint our jewellery holder with acrylic paint in the color and pattern we want.
		<br> - Finally, we varnish our jewellery holder so that the paint does not come off and wear out.
		<br> - I am sure that it's amazing. Enjoy it!
