<p><font color="#F8F5F5" size="4">It is almost impossible to say that I have not heard of this band because it is one of the metal bands with the most fans in the whole world and
Metallica is the first band that comes to mind when it comes to metal music. The more the audience loves Metallica, the more people dislike his music.
just as much. Among the reasons for this, first of all, Metallica has a lot of fans and the age difference of these fans is large.
 Here comes the generational problem. Someone who we can call 'teenager' can listen to this band at the age of 15, or
an adult with children. Despite everything, it is a huge mistake not to love Metallica by showing its musical talents to the fore.</font></p>
