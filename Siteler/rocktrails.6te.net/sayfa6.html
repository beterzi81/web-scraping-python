<p><font color="#F8F5F5" size="4">And one of my favorite bands is Linkin Park. Linkin Park is one of the most successful rock acts in the world.
They are the first rock band to achieve 1 million views on Youtube. They have 2 Grammy awards. If I had to write about his music

It has a metal quartet carrying factors. The only negative about Linkin Park is that Chester Bennington committed suicide
